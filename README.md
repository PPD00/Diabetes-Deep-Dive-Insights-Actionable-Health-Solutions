# Diabetes Deep Dive: Insights & Actionable Health Solutions


## Project Objective

Analyze diabetic patient data to uncover key insights into demographic trends, health conditions, and risk factors. 

By identifying patterns, the goal is to recommend targeted interventions for improved diabetes management and care.
## Tool used :
- Power BI, DAX, Power Query
- Excel (data cleaning)

## Insights :

- Analyzes 100K diabetic patients, providing a view of diabetes-related health conditions.

-  58.6K female patients exceed the 41.4K male patients, indicating a higher chance of diabetes among women.

- The majority of patients are either overweight (45.8K) or obese (23.5K), which significantly correlates with diabetes risk.

- The 50-60 age group is the most affected, with nearly 15K patients, and the 40-70 age range shows the highest diabetes prevalence.

- Heart Disease & Hypertension are most prevalent in the 60-70 age group, with 2.4K patients showing both complications.

-  Only 14.1K patients have good glucose control, with 30.9K falling under fair control and 10.9K under poor control, indicating the need for better management.

- A small portion of patients (8.5K) are underweight, which may still present health risks and needs targeted care.

- Smoking cessation efforts should target the 9.3K current smokers, as smoking is a key risk factor for worsening diabetes outcomes.
## Recommendation :

- Focus on personalized treatment plans for the 30.9K patients in the "fair control" category, highlighting medication adjustments to prevent them from falling into the "poor control" category.

- Since people aged 40-70 are more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure, healthcare providers should focus on preventing these issues with regular check-ups and early treatment.

- Teach patients more about managing diabetes, like how to check their blood sugar, follow their treatment plans, and make lifestyle changes to stay healthy.

- For the 41,300 people with prediabetes, introduce measures like better eating habits, more exercise, and regular check-ups to stop them from developing diabetes.
